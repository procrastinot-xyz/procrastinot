							<h2>The Market & Network Effects</h2>
						</header>
						<img class="pricing" src="images/market.png" alt="market" />
						<p>Procrastinot faces a two-sided market. On the one side the users benefit from a larger number of content and videos because it simply gives them a broader range to choose from. The other side - content producers (in our case teachers) - benefit from a larger number of users, because a greater audience gives them the opportunity to get more popular as a teacher and instructor. On the long run a good reputation may help them to sell books or some students from the online platform may also attend courses or talks they hold in the “real world”. </p>
						<hr />
						<h3>The Students</h3>
						<p>The teachers can be considered the subsidy side. The reason is that teachers can relatively easily switch to another platform and offer their videos and learning material somewhere else. Furthermore, it is crucial for procrastinot to offer high-quality content. The customers, on the other hand, will stick to the platform and pay for using it when the quality is high as well as other requirements are met such as fair pricing and service availability as well as usability.
						</p>
						<h3>The Teachers</h3>
						<p>Consumers (students) as well as content providers (teachers) have no demand for a large variety of learning platforms. Additionally, economies of scale exist on the supply side as well as on the demand side. Students are likely to form a community on procrastinot which can give the platform another competitive advantage and makes it more powerful. The platform itself doesn’t face linear costs for every new customer.
							→ The market is tippy!
